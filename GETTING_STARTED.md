## 🐛 COMMON ISSUES & SOLUTIONS

### "I don't know Python!"
**Solution:** That's okay! Start with PYTHON_BASICS.md. Take it slow, practice daily.

### "My code doesn't work!"
**Solution:**
1. Read the error message carefully
2. Check for typos
3. Compare with Members 1 & 2 code
4. Ask in team group chat

### "I'm stuck on a function!"
**Solution:**
1. Look at similar function in Member 1 or 2 code
2. Break it into smaller steps
3. Test each step individually
4. Ask coordinator for help

### "How do modules talk to each other?"
**Solution:** Through files! One module writes, another reads. See PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md for diagrams.

### "I'm behind schedule!"
**Solution:**
1. Ask team for help
2. Simplify your module (basic version first)
3. Focus on core features
4. Polish later if time permits

## 💡 PRO TIPS

### For Learning Faster
1. **Type, don't copy-paste** - muscle memory helps
2. **Break code** - see what errors teach you
3. **Explain to others** - best way to understand
4. **Google errors** - most have been solved before

### For Better Code
1. **Test often** - don't wait until the end
2. **Use comments** - future you will thank you
3. **Meaningful names** - `student_coins` > `sc`
4. **One thing at a time** - don't code everything at once

### For Great Presentation
1. **Practice the demo** - Murphy's law is real
2. **Speak clearly** - don't rush
3. **Make eye contact** - engage the audience
4. **Be enthusiastic** - your project is cool!
