**What You Say (45 seconds):**
"Right now, campus life has some serious problems. First, there's no motivation to help others - everyone works in their own bubble. Second, when someone does something good, it goes completely unrecognized. Third, campus life feels routine and boring - same classes, same schedule, nothing to look forward to. And fourth, there's minimal community engagement. Students don't interact beyond their friend groups. We asked ourselves: how do we fix this?"

Step two: earn MemeCoins, our digital currency. Every good deed is rewarded. You also build reputation and level up. Step three: spend those coins on real perks that make campus life easier - skip the canteen queue, borrow premium notes, get priority seating. And step four: compete! Climb leaderboards, trade memes as collectibles, earn achievements. It's like turning campus into an RPG game where kindness and engagement actually pay off. Now let me show you how our system works with a real example, and then each team member will explain their part."

**What You Say (1 minute):**
"Let me show you this in action. Meet Rahat - he's stuck on a Python assignment, deadline's tomorrow. He posts a quest: 'Help debug my code - 15 coins reward.' Ahmed sees it, accepts it, spends 30 minutes helping. The code is fixed, assignment saved. What does Ahmed get? 15 MemeCoins, a 'First Helper' achievement, reputation points, and he moves up the leaderboard. Rahat's assignment is saved, and they've formed a new friendship. Later, Ahmed saves up his coins and buys a 'Canteen Queue Skip' perk, saving him 15 minutes during lunch rush. Being helpful literally paid off. This is the power of gamification. Now, let me hand it over to our team members to explain exactly how each part works."

**What You Say (1 minute):**
"I coded five main functions. First, register_student creates new accounts with starting values of 100 coins and level 1. Second, login_student verifies the ID exists and loads their data. Third, display_profile shows all their stats in a nice format. Fourth - and this is important - update_student_coins is called by OTHER modules. When the Quest module wants to give a reward, they call my function. When the Perk Shop needs to charge someone, they call my function. I handle all coin changes centrally to prevent errors. I also check if they leveled up and update their title automatically. Fifth, unlock_achievement adds new badges to their collection. In my demo, I'll show you registration, login, viewing a profile, and what happens when coins are updated."

"Here's my data structure. Every quest is stored in quests.txt with all its details. For example, quest Q001 is 'Help 5 Juniors' - it's an Academic quest with Medium difficulty worth 50 coins. It was created by student NSU210101, it's currently Active, and two students have accepted it. The quest goes through a lifecycle: it's created, stays active while people work on it, and when someone completes it, the status changes to 'Completed' and I distribute the reward by calling Member 1's update_coins function. Multiple students can accept the same quest, but only the one who completes it gets the reward. Now let me show you the functions."

**What You Say (1 minute):**
"I coded five main functions. First, view_quests displays all active quests on the board. Second, create_quest lets anyone post a new quest - I collect the details, generate a unique ID, and save it. Third, accept_quest adds a student to the participants list so they can work on it. Fourth - the most important - complete_quest verifies they accepted it, marks it completed, and THIS is where I call Member 1's functions. I call update_student_coins to add the reward, and if it's their first quest, I call unlock_achievement. This integration is crucial - I don't manage coins myself, I ask Member 1 to do it. Fifth, view_my_quests shows your personal quest history. In my demo, I'll create a quest, accept it, complete it, and show how the coins update."

```

**What You Say (45 seconds):**
"Here's how I store meme NFTs. Each one has a unique ID, a name, description of the moment, who created it, its rarity, current price, who owns it, and how many likes it has. For example, NFT001 'CSE Power Cut' was created by student NSU210101, it's Legendary rarity worth 100 coins, currently owned by NSU210505, and has 89 likes. The rarity isn't random - it's based on how unique the moment was, how many likes it gets, and the creator's reputation. Popular memes become more valuable over time, like vintage collectibles. Now let me show you the actual functions."

```

**What You Say (1 minute):**
"I coded five main functions. First, create_meme generates a new NFT with a rarity determined by an algorithm - I use randomness but weight it so Legendary is rare. Second, browse_marketplace displays all available memes sorted by popularity. Third, buy_meme is where I work with Member 1 - I check the buyer has enough coins, then call Member 1 to deduct coins from the buyer, add them to the seller, and update both their NFT collections. Fourth, view_collection shows all memes you own and calculates your collection's total value. Fifth, like_meme lets students vote on memes, and popular ones can upgrade in rarity. In my demo, I'll create a meme, list it on the marketplace, show someone buying it, and demonstrate the collection view."

💰 CORE FUNCTIONS:
   • Direct Coin Transfers
   • Transaction Logging
   • Good Deed Verification
   • Reputation Calculation
   • Transaction History

🤝 THE CONCEPT:
   Beyond quests, let students directly reward
   each other for help, kindness, and support!

   Examples:
   • "Thanks for helping me move" → 20 coins
   • "Great study session!" → 15 coins
   • "Covered my shift" → 25 coins
   • "Emotional support" → 10 coins

✅ VERIFICATION SYSTEM:
   Sender creates transaction →
   Receiver can verify it was legit →
   Verified transactions boost reputation →
   Reputation affects leaderboards

💯 REPUTATION SCORING:
   • Verified transactions sent: +10 points each
   • Verified transactions received: +5 points each
   • Unverified: 0 points (prevent gaming)
   • Total reputation visible on profile

🔗 HOW IT CONNECTS:
   Works with Member 1 for coin transfers
   Works with Member 6 for reputation rankings
```

**What You Say (30 seconds):**
"Hi, I'm [Name] and I built the Social Credit Engine - the trust system of our economy! While quests are formal, I handle peer-to-peer transactions. Students can directly send coins to each other for any reason - helped with homework? Send some coins! Covered someone's shift? Get rewarded! The key innovation is verification - recipients confirm the help was real, which builds reputation. High reputation means high trust in the community. Let me show you how it works."

```

**What You Say (45 seconds):**
"Every transaction goes into transactions.txt with complete details. For example, T001 shows NSU210101 sent 10 coins to NSU210505 for 'Helped with code' at 2:30 PM. The verified field starts as False. When the receiver confirms the help was real, it becomes True. This prevents people from gaming the system by sending coins to friends for no reason. Verified transactions count toward reputation - senders get 10 points, receivers get 5. Unverified? Zero points. This creates accountability and builds a trust network. Now let me show you the functions."

    💰 RECEIVED: 15 coins from NSU210202 (Unverified)"

3️⃣ VERIFY_TRANSACTION(txn_id, verifier_id)
   Input:  Transaction ID, Who's verifying
   Process: • Find transaction
            • Check verifier is the receiver
            • Change verified to True
            • Update reputation for both parties
            • Save changes
   Output:  "✅ Transaction verified! Rep updated"

   REPUTATION UPDATE:
   • Sender: +10 points
   • Receiver: +5 points
   • Both profiles updated via Member 1

4️⃣ CALCULATE_REPUTATION(student_id)
   Purpose: Compute total reputation score
   Process: • Read all transactions
            • Count verified ones sent (× 10)
            • Count verified ones received (× 5)

              - Student is receiver
              - Verified = False
   Output:  List of transactions needing verification
```

**What You Say (1 minute):**
"I coded five main functions. First, send_coins handles the transfer - I verify the sender has enough money, then call Member 1 twice: once to deduct from the sender, once to credit the receiver. The transaction is logged as unverified initially. Second, view_transactions shows your complete history - what you sent, what you received, and verification status. Third, verify_transaction lets the receiver confirm it was legit, which updates reputation for both people. Fourth, calculate_reputation adds up all verified transactions to create a trust score - Member 6 uses this for leaderboards. Fifth, get_unverified_transactions shows people what needs verification. In my demo, I'll send coins, show the history, verify a transaction, and display the reputation increase."

EXAMPLE: "Richest Students" Leaderboard
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Step 1: Read students.txt
Step 2: Extract all students into a list
Step 3: Sort list by coins (highest first)
Step 4: Take top 10
Step 5: Display with rankings

Code Logic (Pseudocode):
1. students = read_all_students()
2. sorted_students = sort(students, by="coins", reverse=True)
3. top_10 = sorted_students[0:10]
4. for each student in top_10:

```

**What You Say (45 seconds):**
"My module is unique because I don't create any new data - I'm purely analytical. I read from everyone else's files and process that information to create rankings and stats. For example, to create the 'Richest Students' leaderboard, I read students.txt from Member 1, load all students into a list, sort them by coins in descending order, take the top 10, and display them with medals. For 'Quest Leaders', I read quests.txt from Member 2 and count how many each student completed. I cross-reference multiple files to calculate complex stats like 'Most Active Student' which considers quests, transactions, AND memes. Now let me show you all the leaderboards."

            • Calculate for this student:
               - Total earned (quests + transactions received)
               - Total spent (perks + transactions sent)
               - Current balance
               - Quest completion rate
               - Memes created & total likes
               - Reputation score
               - Position in each leaderboard
   Output: Complete stats dashboard

6️⃣ GET_TRENDING_STUDENTS()
   Purpose: Who improved most recently
   Process: • Compare current stats to 7 days ago
            • Calculate percentage growth
            • Rank by growth rate
   Output: Rising stars

RANKING ALGORITHM EXAMPLE:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
For "Most Active Overall":
Score = (Quests × 10) + (Memes × 5) + (Transactions × 2)

Student A: (15 × 10) + (3 × 5) + (20 × 2) = 205
Student B: (10 × 10) + (8 × 5) + (15 × 2) = 170
Student C: (20 × 10) + (1 × 5) + (10 × 2) = 225

Ranking: C > A > B
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

**What You Say (1 minute):**
"I coded six main functions. First, show_richest reads students.txt and sorts by coins - simple but effective. Second, show_quest_leaders counts completed quests for everyone by parsing quests.txt. Third, show_most_helpful sums up verified transactions sent - this rewards generosity. Fourth, show_meme_kings combines creation count with total likes to find the best creators. Fifth, show_analytics is the most complex - I read ALL files and create a complete dashboard for one student showing everything about their performance. Sixth, get_trending_students compares current stats to historical data to find who's improving fastest. In my demo, I'll show all the leaderboards and explain the ranking algorithms I used."

KEY INTERACTIONS:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
• Quests → Profiles: Add reward coins
• Perks → Profiles: Deduct purchase coins
• Social → Profiles: Transfer coins between students
• Memes → Profiles: Handle NFT trades
• All → Leaderboards: Provide data for rankings

DATA FLOW EXAMPLE: Completing a Quest
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
User → Main Menu → Quest Module → 
"Complete Q001 worth 50 coins" → 
Quest calls Profile Module → 
Profile adds 50 coins → 
Profile checks level up → 
Profile saves to students.txt → 
Success message to user
```

**What You Say (1 minute):**
"Let me show you how beautifully all six modules work together. At the center is the Main Menu - that's my code - which routes users to each module. But notice the star pattern: Member 1's Profile module is at the center of everything. Why? Because everyone needs to manage coins, and we centralized that to prevent errors. When Member 2 completes a quest, they don't directly change the coins - they CALL Member 1's function. When Member 4 sells a perk, they CALL Member 1. This design prevents conflicts and ensures data integrity. Member 6 reads from everyone to create rankings. All communication happens through text files, which act like our database. It's simple, elegant, and it works perfectly."
