RESEARCH: 73% of students report low campus engagement
          Only 12% participate in extracurricular activities
```

**What You Say (45 seconds):**
"Current campus life has four critical problems. First, there's no motivation to help others - everyone competes rather than collaborates. Second, good deeds go completely unrecognized. Third, campus life is routine and boring. Fourth, engagement is extremely low. Research shows 73% of students report low engagement. We asked: what if we could solve all four problems with one system? That's what we built."

## SLIDE 5: INTRODUCTION & ARCHITECTURE

**Content:**
```
👤 Module 1: Student Profile System
Presented by: [Your Name]
Lines of Code: 320 | File: member1_profiles.py

I'M THE FOUNDATION - EVERYONE DEPENDS ON ME
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

MY RESPONSIBILITIES:
✓ Student registration & authentication
✓ Profile data management
✓ COIN BALANCE MANAGEMENT ← Everyone calls me!
✓ Level & title progression system
✓ Achievement tracking & unlocking
✓ NFT collection management
✓ Reputation score tracking

WHY I'M CRITICAL:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
All other modules call MY functions to:
• Member 2 (Quests) → update_student_coins() to give rewards
• Member 3 (Memes) → update_student_coins() for trading
• Member 4 (Perks) → update_student_coins() to charge
• Member 5 (Social) → update_student_coins() for transfers

I CENTRALIZE all coin operations to prevent conflicts!

MY DATA STRUCTURE (students.txt):
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
id|name|coins|level|title|reputation|nfts|achievements
NSU210101|Ahmed|150|2|Noob|10||First Blood
        ↑      ↑   ↑   ↑    ↑         ↑
     100+50  Lvl2 Auto NFTs  Auto   Unlocked
     (quest)      calc       by me
```

**What You Say (1 minute):**
"Hi, I'm [Name] and I built the Student Profile System - the foundation of the entire project. I wrote 320 lines of code that handle everything related to student data. But here's the key point: I'm not just managing profiles - I'm the CENTRAL HUB for the whole system. Every time someone needs to add or remove coins, they call MY function: update_student_coins(). When Member 2 completes a quest? They call me to add the reward. When Member 4 sells a perk? They call me to charge. This centralized design prevents conflicts and ensures data integrity. I also automatically calculate levels based on coins - every 100 coins equals one level - and I manage achievements, NFT collections, and reputation scores. Let me show you exactly how my data is stored."

## SLIDE 6: DATA STORAGE & KEY FUNCTION

**Content:**
```
📁 How I Store Everything (students.txt)

FILE FORMAT (Pipe-Separated Values):
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Field 1: student_id      → "NSU210101"
Field 2: name            → "Ahmed Khan"
Field 3: coins           → 150
Field 4: level           → 2
Field 5: title           → "Noob"
Field 6: reputation      → 10
Field 7: nft_collection  → "Drake,Pikachu" (comma-separated)
Field 8: achievements    → "First Blood,Helper" (comma-separated)

REAL EXAMPLE:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
NSU210101|Ahmed Khan|150|2|Noob|10|Drake,Pikachu|First Blood,Helper
NSU210102|Rahat Ali|235|3|Regular|15||First Blood

TITLE PROGRESSION (Automatic):
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Level 1-3:  "Noob" 😊
Level 4-6:  "Regular" 👍
Level 7-9:  "Meme Lord" 🔥
Level 10:   "Legend" 👑

THE MOST IMPORTANT FUNCTION: update_student_coins()
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Called by: Members 2, 3, 4, 5

Function Flow:
1. Read all students from students.txt
2. Find the specific student by ID
3. Add or subtract the amount
4. Prevent negative balance (min = 0)
5. Calculate new level: (coins ÷ 100) + 1
6. Check if level changed → update title
7. Save all students back to file
8. Display level up message if applicable

CODE SNIPPET (Lines 106-145):
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
def update_student_coins(student_id, amount):
    students = get_all_students()
    for student in students:
        if student['id'] == student_id:
            student['coins'] += amount
            if student['coins'] < 0:
                student['coins'] = 0
            new_level = (student['coins'] // 100) + 1
            if new_level != old_level:
                # Update level and title
                # Show level up message
            save_all_students(students)
            return True
```

**What You Say (1 minute):**
"Here's exactly how I store data. Everything goes into students.txt in pipe-separated format. Each field has a specific purpose, and I automatically calculate titles based on level. The most critical function I wrote is update_student_coins() - it's called by four other modules whenever coins need to change. Here's what it does: reads all students, finds the right one, adds or subtracts coins, prevents negative balances, calculates if they leveled up, updates their title, saves everything back, and shows a level-up message if they advanced. This function is called dozens of times during normal use, so I made it bulletproof with error checking and automatic calculations. Now let me show you my full function list."

**What You Say (1 minute):**
"I wrote 11 functions total. Eight are public - called by other modules. The star function is update_student_coins, called by four different modules whenever coins change. The others handle achievements, NFT collections, and reputation. I also wrote three helper functions that handle file operations internally. Here's what integration looks like: when Member 2 completes a quest, they simply call my update_student_coins function with the reward amount. My code handles adding the coins, checking for level ups, saving the file, and returning success. Then they call unlock_achievement if needed. It's clean, simple, and works perfectly. My 320 lines form the backbone of the entire system."

✓ Quest completion verification
✓ Reward distribution (calls Member 1!)
✓ Achievement triggering

QUEST TYPES (4 Categories):
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
📚 Academic:  Tutoring, study groups, sharing notes
🎉 Social:    Events, helping new students, cleanup
🎨 Creative:  Memes, content creation, design work
🏆 Campus:    Seminars, competitions, representing university

DIFFICULTY & REWARDS:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Easy:    10-30 MemeCoins   (Simple tasks)
Medium:  30-60 MemeCoins   (Moderate effort)
Hard:    60-100 MemeCoins  (Significant work)

MY DATA STRUCTURE (quests.txt):

```

**What You Say (1 minute):**
"Hi, I'm [Name] and I built the Quest System - the main way students earn MemeCoins. I wrote 280 lines that handle the entire quest lifecycle. Students can create quests with rewards, others can accept them, and when completed, the system automatically distributes coins by calling Member 1's functions. I designed four quest types: Academic for tutoring, Social for events, Creative for content, and Campus for university activities. Each quest has a difficulty level that guides the reward amount - Easy quests pay 10-30 coins, Hard quests up to 100. The beauty is in the lifecycle: a quest is created, appears on the board, someone accepts it, they complete it, and the system handles everything automatically including rewards and achievements."

## SLIDE 9: KEY FUNCTIONS & INTEGRATION

**Content:**
```
⚙️ Core Functions - Quest Lifecycle Management

1. CREATE_QUEST(creator_id) - Lines 60-105
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
What it does:
• Asks user for quest details (title, description)
• Gets reward amount
• Gets type (Academic/Social/Creative/Campus)
• Gets difficulty (Easy/Medium/Hard)
• Generates unique ID (Q001, Q002, Q003...)
• Writes to quests.txt with status "Active"

User Input Example:
  Title: "Help with Python"
  Description: "Debug my code"
  Reward: 20 coins
  Type: Academic
  Difficulty: Medium
  
Generated: Q003|Help with Python|Debug my code|20|Academic|Medium|NSU210101|Active|

2. ACCEPT_QUEST(student_id, quest_id) - Lines 108-148
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Validation checks:
✓ Quest exists?
✓ Quest is Active?
✓ Student isn't the creator? (can't accept own quest)
✓ Student hasn't already accepted?

If all pass:
• Add student to participants list
• Save back to quests.txt
• Show confirmation

Before: Q003|...|Active|
After:  Q003|...|Active|NSU210202

3. COMPLETE_QUEST(student_id, quest_id) - Lines 151-190
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
THE MONEY FUNCTION! This is where coins are earned.

Verification:
✓ Student accepted this quest?
✓ Quest still Active (not already completed)?

If verified:
1. Mark quest as Completed
2. CALL MEMBER 1 to give reward:
   
   profiles.update_student_coins(student_id, reward)
   
3. Check achievement milestones:
   If first quest: unlock "First Blood"
   If 10th quest: unlock "Quest Master"
   
4. Show success message with coin amount

INTEGRATION EXAMPLE:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
# Line 157 in my code:
profiles.update_student_coins(student_id, quest['reward'])

# Member 1's function executes:
# - Reads students.txt
# - Finds student
# - Adds reward coins
# - Checks level up
# - Saves students.txt

# Line 165 in my code:
if completed_count == 1:
    profiles.unlock_achievement(student_id, "First Blood")

Perfect collaboration!
```

**What You Say (1 minute):**
"I wrote three core functions. First, create_quest collects all details from the user, generates a unique ID, and saves to quests.txt. Second, accept_quest validates that the student can join - they can't accept their own quest, and they can't accept twice. If valid, it adds them to the participants list. Third, and most important, complete_quest - this is where the money flows. It verifies the student accepted the quest, marks it completed, then calls Member 1's update_student_coins function to add the reward. Member 1 handles all the coin logic. I also check achievement milestones - first quest unlocks 'First Blood'. This is perfect integration - I focus on quest logic, Member 1 handles coin management."

I'M THE CREATIVE ECONOMY - COLLECTIBLES & TRADING
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

MY RESPONSIBILITIES:
✓ Meme NFT creation with RANDOM rarity
✓ Marketplace browsing & display
✓ Buy/Sell trading system
✓ NFT collection management
✓ Like/Rating system (affects value!)
✓ Price setting for owned memes

THE RARITY ALGORITHM (Lines 39-48):
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
def determine_rarity():
    roll = random.randint(1, 100)
    if roll >= 95:   return "Legendary", 100 coins
    elif roll >= 80: return "Epic", 70 coins
    elif roll >= 50: return "Rare", 40 coins
    else:            return "Common", 15 coins

Probabilities:
• 5% chance  → Legendary (100 coins)
• 15% chance → Epic (70 coins)
• 30% chance → Rare (40 coins)
• 50% chance → Common (15 coins)

MY DATA STRUCTURE (memes.txt):

                                  rarity     price

LIKE SYSTEM (Dynamic Pricing):
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Every 10 likes → Price increases by 5 coins!
Popular memes become more valuable over time.
```

**What You Say (1 minute):**
"Hi, I'm [Name] and I built the Meme NFT Marketplace - where campus moments become tradeable collectibles. I wrote 290 lines that turn inside jokes into valuable assets. The coolest part is my rarity algorithm - when someone creates a meme, Python randomly determines if it's Common, Rare, Epic, or Legendary. A 1-100 dice roll: 95+ gets Legendary worth 100 coins, 80-94 gets Epic worth 70 coins, and so on. This makes creating memes exciting - you might get lucky! I also built a like system where every 10 likes increases a meme's price by 5 coins, so popular memes naturally become more valuable. Students can create memes, trade them, collect them, and build valuable portfolios."

## SLIDE 12: TRADING SYSTEM & INTEGRATION

**Content:**
```
💰 The Buy/Sell System - Complex Integration

BUY_MEME FUNCTION (Lines 109-158) - My Most Complex Code
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Step-by-Step Process:

1. VALIDATION CHECKS:
   ✓ Does meme exist?
   ✓ Does buyer already own it? (can't buy what you have)
   ✓ Does buyer have enough coins?
   
   buyer = profiles.get_student_by_id(buyer_id)
   if buyer['coins'] < meme['price']:
       Print "Not enough coins!"
       Return False

2. PAYMENT PROCESSING (Calls Member 1 twice!):
   
   seller_id = meme['owner_id']
   price = meme['price']
   
   # Deduct from buyer:
   profiles.update_student_coins(buyer_id, -price)
   
   # Credit seller:
   profiles.update_student_coins(seller_id, +price)

3. NFT COLLECTION UPDATES (Calls Member 1 twice!):
   
   # Remove from seller's collection:
   profiles.remove_nft_from_collection(seller_id, meme_name)
   
   # Add to buyer's collection:
   profiles.add_nft_to_collection(buyer_id, meme_name)

4. UPDATE OWNERSHIP:
   meme['owner_id'] = buyer_id
   Save back to memes.txt

5. ACHIEVEMENT CHECK:
   Count buyer's NFTs
   If count >= 10:
       profiles.unlock_achievement(buyer_id, "Collector")

Ahmed wants to buy NFT001 (100 coins) from Rahat

My code:
1. profiles.update_student_coins("Ahmed", -100)
   → Ahmed: 150 - 100 = 50 coins

2. profiles.update_student_coins("Rahat", +100)
   → Rahat: 120 + 100 = 220 coins

3. profiles.remove_nft_from_collection("Rahat", "Power Cut")
   → Rahat loses NFT

4. profiles.add_nft_to_collection("Ahmed", "Power Cut")
   → Ahmed gains NFT

5. Update meme owner in memes.txt

All atomic - if any step fails, nothing happens!

OTHER KEY FUNCTIONS:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
• create_meme() - Random rarity assignment
• like_meme() - Increments likes, may increase price
• view_collection() - Shows owned NFTs with total value
• set_price() - Owner can change selling price
```

**What You Say (1 minute):**
"My buy_meme function is the most complex - it orchestrates a complete trade. First, validation: does the meme exist, does the buyer already own it, do they have enough coins? Second, payment processing by calling Member 1's update_student_coins twice - once to deduct from buyer, once to credit seller. Third, NFT collection updates by calling Member 1's add and remove functions. Fourth, update the meme's owner in my file. Fifth, check if they earned the Collector achievement for owning 10 NFTs. The key is it's atomic - if any step fails, nothing happens. For example, if Ahmed buys a 100-coin meme from Rahat, my code calls Member 1 four times to handle all the coin and collection updates, then I update my memes file. Perfect separation of concerns."

**What You Say (1 minute):**
"I built eight functions total. The three core ones are create_meme with random rarity, buy_meme with complex multi-step trading, and view_collection to see your portfolio. I also have like_meme which makes popular memes more expensive, set_price for owners to adjust pricing, and browse_marketplace to see everything. My buy function calls Member 1 four times per trade - twice for coins, twice for NFT collections. Member 6 calls my get_all_memes function to build the meme king leaderboard. I wrote 290 lines - 190 for core trading, 40 for rarity and likes, 60 for menus. It's a complete trading platform for campus inside jokes."
